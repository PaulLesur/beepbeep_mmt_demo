/**
 * An example of BeepBeep's usage: a distribution of the number of connections per port for each connection event of a log file.
 * <p>
 *  The port number of each connection goes through the chain of processors.
 *  a PNG image is then generated to display the resulting distribution on a graph.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *  This example illustrates the use of {@link BarChartGenerator} processor.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *  Represented graphically, this example corresponds to the following chain of processors:
